    "### Probability and Bayes' Theorem\n",
    "- Whether we are talking about the frequentist or Bayesian interpretation, probability is always a statement about \n",
    "uncertainty. It is expressed as a number between 0 and 1, where a zero indicates something impossible, a 1 indicates \n",
    "something certain, and a probability of 0-point-5 indicates something is equally likely to happen or not happen. A probability that some event will occur is typically denoted with the capital \"P\" followed by the event in question in parentheses. This notation means there is a 75% chance of rain tomorrow."
